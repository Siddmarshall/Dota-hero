		<h2>About Pudge</h2>
		<p>Pudge is a melee strength hero in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2">Dota2</a>. Pudge is potentially one of the strongest gankers and disablers in the entire game, with his combo of three active abilities proving more than sufficient to kill fragile enemy heroes in the early and mid-game</p>
